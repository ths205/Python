This program is to get the Weather data from the Chicago, New York, and Los Angelas csv files and
calculate mean, max, min and standard deviation using version Python 2.7. The user would have to
put in losangelas, newyork, honolulu or chicago at the command line in order to get the data of a specific csv file.
